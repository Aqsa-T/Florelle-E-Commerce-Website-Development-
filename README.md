# Florelle-E-Commerce-Website-Development-
Florelle - an E-Commerce Website Development Project 
I designed a clean and elegant e-commerce landing page for Florelle, a floral brand. The website features a soft pastel theme, a product carousel, bouquet cards with prices, a search bar, and a dedicated customer reviews section. It includes full shopping functionality such as viewing products, adding items to the cart, and continuing the shopping flow. The layout and structure follow front-end development principles using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts to ensure smooth navigation and an easy, user-friendly shopping experience.
